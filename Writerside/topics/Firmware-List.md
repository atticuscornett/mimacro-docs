# Firmware List

For devices that [support automatic flashing](Supported-Microcontrollers.md), we recommend letting
mimacro choose the firmware that works best and automatically update it when needed.
To ensure your device is always on the correct firmware version, make sure that "Automatically update device firmware"
is turned on in mimacro settings.

For devices that do not support automatic flashing (or troubleshooting devices that do),
you can find mimacro firmware downloads below.
